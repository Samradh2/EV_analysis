EV Consumer Behavior Analysis
This project analyzes the socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics of consumers who have purchased electric vehicles (EVs). Using a diverse dataset containing attributes like age, profession, marital status, education, dependents, income, car loan status, and EV price, we identify trends and behaviors to inform targeted marketing strategies.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling null values, renaming columns, and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between demographic factors and car loan status, as well as analyzing distributions of features like age, dependents, income, and EV price.
Clustering with K-Prototypes: Implementing the K-Prototypes algorithm to cluster consumers based on categorical and numerical features, providing insights into different consumer segments.
Visualization: Creating pie charts, count plots, and histograms to illustrate car loan preferences and feature distributions.
Key insights show that 45% of EV buyers are unmarried men, 35% are married individuals, 12% are unmarried women, and 8% fall under miscellaneous categories.
